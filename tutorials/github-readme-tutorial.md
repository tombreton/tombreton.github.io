# Create Your GitHub Profile README

A GitHub profile README is like a digital business card- it shows who you are and what you love! This tutorial guides you through creating one, no coding skills required. Perfect for beginners, this step-by-step guide will have you showcasing your skills in no time.

*Portfolio Note*: This tutorial is part of my technical writing portfolio, demonstrating my ability to create clear, engaging, and beginner-friendly documentation.

 ## Step 1: Create the Repository

1. Click the plus sign (+) in the upper-right corner of the GitHub page. ![Plus Icon](/images/plusicon.PNG) 
2. Click **New Repository**

5. Type a repository name identical to your username (e.g., 'tombreton' for username 'tombreton'). This is not case-sensitive and ensures the README appears on your profile page.

8. Write a clear, concise overview of your profile in the description field to make your README appealing, such as "My GitHub profile showcasing coding projects and hobbies!"
9. Select **Public** to make your README visible to everyone. Then check **Initialize this repository with a README**.

10. Click **Create Repository**, and your new repository page will appear.

## Step 2: Edit the README

1. To edit, click the pen icon next to the 'README.md' file on the repository page.

2. You'll see several lines of text in the edit view. The first line should say ### Hi There, but it might differ if GitHub changes the default README content.

3. The ### before "Hi there" controls the text size in Markdown, a simple programming language that's easy for beginners to learn. Changing the number of '#'s changes the heading size: '#' is the largest (like a title), '##' is medium (like a subtitle), and '###' is small (like a subheading). Check [GitHub's Markdown Guide](https://docs.github/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) for more tips. Change the line to '#Howdy Y'all!'

4. Click *Preview* above the editing area to see how the text looks. Feel free to change the text or heading size. Preview your changes anytime.

5. Lines 3 and 16 have special code (like '<!--' and '-->) that hides other lines in Preview. Delete these lines to make all your text visible. Edit the remaining lines or delete as you wish. This is a great place to add skills, hobbies, or interests- anything you want to share! For example, write "I love coding Python, hiking, and sci-fi movies!"
6. When happy with your README, click **Commit changes**, then confirm in the pop-up. In GitHub, "commit" means save your changes.

## Troubleshooting

-If your README doesn't show on your profile, check that the repository name matches your username exactly.
-Ensure the repository is set to **Public**, not **Private**.
